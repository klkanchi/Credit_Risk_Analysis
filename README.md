# Credit_Risk_Analysis



## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to build and evaluate various machine learning models to evaluate individual customer credit risk. The dataset used to train the models was from LendingClub, "a peer-to-peer lending services company." After being cleaned, the dataset consisted of 68,817 entries, and was heavily unbalanced, with only 0.5% of entries being classified as "high-risk." 




The machine learning algorithms used were:

RandomOverSampler
SMOTE
ClusterCentroids
SMOTEENN
BalancedRandomForestClassifier
EasyEnsembleClassifier
The models were run and then evaluated for performance and accuracy at predicting credit risk.
